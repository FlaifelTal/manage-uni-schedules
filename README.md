# manage-uni-schedules
 python script that suggests course schedules for university students. The script will parse the study plan and list of
elective courses to determine which courses computer engineering students must pass in order to graduate.
The script will also parse the available courses from the course browser for the first, second, and summer
semesters. The script will then parse the courses that the student has already passed from their student
records. Based on this information, the script will suggest a course schedule for the student to follow until
graduation. The student can specify preferences such as the maximum number of credits he or she wants to
register for during the first, second, and summer semesters. The student can also choose the number of free
days per week for each semester.
